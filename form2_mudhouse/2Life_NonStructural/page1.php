<p>1. Acceleration or Displacement Hazards</p>
<p>a. The shelves inside the house are unanchored.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1a" value="N"> No


<p>b. The lofts inside the house are unanchored.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1b" value="N"> No


<p>c. The objects on/in the lofts/shelves inside the house are unanchored.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1c" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1c" value="N"> No


<p>d. The house has exposed wood and/or combustible materials used in
the construction of the house (either as wall panels, roofs, lofts, or
floors) or exposed cloth in finishing of the house, at points close to
locations of potential stove fire, electricity sparks or gas leakage fire
that can result in a fire in the house during an earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1d" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1d" value="N"> No


<p>e. The house has electricity wires held rigidly between the house and
the street pole with no slack, that can result in short circuiting and
fire during an earthquake.</p>
<input type="radio" name="_1e" value="Y"> Yes
<input type="radio" name="_1e" value="N"> No


<p>f. The gas cylinders are not strapped to the wall, that can result in
toppling of the cylinders, which in turn can lead to gas leakage and
thereby fire during an earthquake.</p>
